# Multi-Source Deep Learning for Crop Yield Prediction: Advancing Precision Agriculture with IoT and Data Fusion

*Abstract:*
Precision agriculture, driven by the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Data Analytics, is revolutionizing traditional farming by providing more convenient and stable systems. These technologies enhance agricultural practices, reduce resource consumption, and optimize food safety. Within this framework, crop yield prediction plays a crucial role. While many deep learning models perform well on single-source data such as climate records or soil parameters, challenges remain when analysing and predicting yields based on the non-linear interactions among multiple data sources such as climate variability, soil dynamics, and crop growth patterns.
This chapter proposes a multi-source deep learning framework that merges climate records, soil properties, and satellite imagery to expand crop yield prediction. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal patterns in climate and crop growth data, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to extract spatial features from satellite images. These features are then integrated through an attention-based fusion layer, which dynamically balances the contribution of each data source. By leveraging this multi-modal approach, the model produces more reliable and robust yield predictions. 
Key research gaps in crop yield prediction, including the dependence on limited data sources, the absence of effective fusion strategies, and challenges with regional adaptability. By demonstrating how multi-source integration with deep learning can enhance precision farming. The findings show how such approaches can support informed decision-making, optimize resource use, and promote climate-resilient farming practices.
